**PoseNet implementation in Keras for Visual Servoing**

This is a slight variant implementation of PoseNet. This model has been implemented using Keras with a tensorflow backend in mind.

The original paper can be viewed [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/1505.07427)

The weights are of Imagenet instead of Places dataset originally used. 

The model can be run by calling `python googlenet.py` 

Please change the training dataset files by editing the lines with the file locations inside the file.
