**PoseNet implementation in Keras for Visual Servoing**

This is a slight variant implementation of PoseNet. This model has been implemented using Keras with a tensorflow backend in mind.

The original paper by Alex Kendall, Matthew Grimes, Roberto Cipolla can be viewed [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/1505.07427)

The weights are of Imagenet instead of Places dataset originally used. 

The model can be run by calling `python googlenet.py`
